    In some scenarios it is desirable to present a simple dialog before 
    the main program commences, for example in the case you
    want the user to to configure resolution and fullscreen settings. 
    While OPENRNDR natively doesn't offer the tools to create user interfaces 
    it does offer the functionality to create a window to host a 
    configuration dialog.
