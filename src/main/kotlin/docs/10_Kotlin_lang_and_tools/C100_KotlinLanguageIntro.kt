    # The Kotlin programming language
    
    Kotlin is a modern, readable and fun language, perfect for
    creative coding.
    
    If you are not familiar with any programming languages
    [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/kotlin/kotlin_intro.php)
    might be a good place to start. 
    
    The website includes a code editor, but you can also use
    the official online editor found at
    [play.kotlinlang.org](https://play.kotlinlang.org/). 
    In this online editor we can type code, run text-based programs 
    (no graphics) and study the output without installing anything 
    on our computer.  
        
    Once we are familiar with the basics we are able 
    to start having fun with OPENRNDR.            

    If you are already familiar with another programming language
    take a quick look at the 
    [basic syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html#program-entry-point).
    
    From the [Official documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
    we recommend exploring the *Basics*, *Concepts* and *Standard Library* sections.
    Data structures like `List`, `Map` and `Set` are explained under the
    *Standard Library* section and they are one of the aspects that make
    working with Kotlin enjoyable. Check them out!
    
    An introduction to Kotlin focused on OPENRNDR will follow soon :-)
