# orx-kinect

Provides Kinect support (only Kinect version 1 at the moment and 
only depth camera).
Source and extra documentation can be found in the 
[orx sourcetree](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/tree/master)

Note: the support is split into several modules:

* `orx-kinect-common`
* `orx-kinect-v1`
* [`orx-kinect-v1-demo`](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/tree/master/orx-jvm/orx-kinect-v1-demo/src/main/kotlin)
* `orx-kinect-v1-natives-linux-x64`
* `orx-kinect-v1-natives-macos`
* `orx-kinect-v1-natives-windows`

## Prerequisites

Assuming you are working on an 
[`openrndr-template`](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template) based
project, all you have to do is enable `orx-kinect-v1` in the `orxFeatures`
set in `build.gradle.kts` and reimport the gradle project.

## Using the Kinect depth camera 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {
        // default resolution of the Kinect v1 depth camera
        width = 640
        height = 480
    }
    program {
        val kinect = Kinect1()
        val device = kinect.openDevice()
        device.depthCamera.flipH = true // to make a mirror
        device.depthCamera.enabled = true
        extend(kinect)
        extend {
            drawer.image(device.depthCamera.currentFrame)
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
Note: depth values are mapped into `0-1` range and stored on a 
`ColorBuffer` containing only RED color channel.

## Mirroring depth camera image

```kotlin 
kinect.depthCamera.mirror = true 
```

## Using multiple Kinects

The `kinects.startDevice()` can be supplied with device number 
(`0` by default): 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {
        width = 640 * 2
        height = 480
    }
    program {
        val kinect = Kinect1()
        val depthCamera1 = kinect.openDevice(0).depthCamera
        val depthCamera2 = kinect.openDevice(1).depthCamera
        depthCamera1.enabled = true
        depthCamera1.flipH = true
        depthCamera2.enabled = true
        depthCamera2.flipH = true
        extend(kinect)
        extend {
            drawer.image(depthCamera1.currentFrame)
            drawer.image(depthCamera2.currentFrame, depthCamera1.resolution.x.toDouble(), 0.0)
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
## Reacting only to the latest frame from the Kinect camera

Kinect is producing 30 frames per second, while screen refresh rates 
are usually higher.
Usually, if the data from the depth camera is processed, it is desired 
to react to the latest Kinect frame only once:

```kotlin
kinect.depthCamera.getLatestFrame()?.let { frame ->
    myFilter.apply(frame, outputColorBuffer)
}
```

## Using color map filters

Raw kinect depth data might be visualized in several ways, the following 
filters are included:

* `DepthToGrayscaleMapper`
* `DepthToColorsZucconi6Mapper` - [Colors of natural light dispersion](https://www.alanzucconi.com/2017/07/15/improving-the-rainbow/) by Alan Zucconi
* `DepthToColorsTurboMapper` - [Turbo, An Improved Rainbow Colormap for Visualization](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html) by Google

[Find a runnable example here](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/blob/master/orx-jvm/orx-kinect-v1-demo/src/main/kotlin/Kinect1Demo03DepthToColorMaps.kt). 

## Executing native freenect commands

This kinect support is built on top of the [freenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect)
library. Even though the access to freenect is abstracted, it is still possible to execute
[low level freenect commands](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/blob/master/orx-jvm/orx-kinect-v1-demo/src/main/kotlin/Kinect1Demo07NativeFreenectCommands.kt)
in the native API.
