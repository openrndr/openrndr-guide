## Extend

The `program` block usually contains an `extend` block
which gets executed as often as possible.     
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        extend {
            drawer.circle(width / 2.0, height / 2.0, 50.0)
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
The `extend` block serves as a "draw loop", which is what we
need for drawing smooth animations. To demonstrate that the
result is not a still image, let's draw a circle located 
wherever the mouse cursor is:
 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        extend {
            drawer.circle(mouse.position, 50.0)
        }
    }
}
```
