# Program basics

Let's have a look at how an OPENRNDR program is structured. 
Most programs will share a structure like the one below. 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    configure {
    // set Configuration options here
    }
    
    program {
        // -- what is here is executed once
        extend {
        // -- what is here is executed 'as often as possible'
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
## application

The `application` block is used to setup the run-time environment 
of the software we are writing. This block houses two other blocks:
`configure` and `program`. Think of it as an `OPENRNDR` application.
