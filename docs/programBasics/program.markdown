## Program
    
The program block houses the actual programming logic. Note that `program {}` has a 
[`Program`](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/blob/v0.4.0-rc.7/openrndr-application/src/commonMain/kotlin/org/openrndr/Program.kt#L63) receiver.

The code inside the `program` block is only executed after a window has 
been created and a graphical context has been set up. This code is only 
executed once.

In the `program` block one can install extensions using `extend`. Extensions 
are by default executed as often as possible. The most important type of
extension is the one holding the user code.

A minimal application-program-extend setup would then look like this: 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        // -- what is here is executed once
        // -- It's a good place to load assets
        extend {
            // -- what is here is executed 'as often as possible'
            drawer.circle(width / 2.0, height / 2.0, 100.0)
        }
    }
}
```
