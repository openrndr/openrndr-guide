## The `NoClear` extension

Creative coding frameworks have two different defaults: either they clear the screen before
each animation frame or they don't. OPENRNDR belongs to the first group.

Switching to "draw-without-clearing-the-screen" can be useful to produce complex designs with simple programs. 

It is also how pen and paper seems to work: we add ink to the paper and the previous ink does not disappear.

Such behavior can easily be enabled by adding `extend(NoClear())` to our programs.    
Here an example that draws circles at the current mouse position: 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        backgroundColor = ColorRGBa.PINK
        extend(NoClear())
        extend {
            drawer.circle(mouse.position, 20.0)
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
Without `NoClear` only one circle would be visible at the current mouse location.
