## The `Camera2D` extension

This extension allows the user to easily pan, rotate and scale
the view using a mouse.

* For panning, click and drag with the left mouse button.
* For scaling, use the mouse wheel.
* For rotating, click and drag with the right mouse button.

Using the `Camera2D` extension can be useful to find the
right framing for a design before taking a screenshot.

You see, sometimes generative design involve randomness,
and by using this extension you can choose what is up and what
is down, and how much space you want between your creation and 
the edges of the window after the design has been created. 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        backgroundColor = ColorRGBa.PINK
        extend(Camera2D())
        extend {
            drawer.rectangle(drawer.bounds.center, 200.0, 50.0)
            drawer.circle(drawer.bounds.position(0.3, 0.3), 100.0)
        }
    }
}
```
