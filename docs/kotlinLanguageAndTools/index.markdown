# Kotlin language and tools

OPENRNDR is written using the Kotlin programming language,
which is similar to Java but more modern and less verbose.

The Gradle build tool is used by the OPENRNDR projects 
to download dependencies, build and distribute projects.

We recommend to have some fun with the [drawing](/drawing/) 
chapter first, then come back to this chapter when you 
start wondering about the language, the syntax and the framework.
