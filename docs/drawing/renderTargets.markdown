# Render targets and color buffers

A `RenderTarget` specifies a place to draw to. A `RenderTarget` has two 
kind of buffer attachments:
`ColorBuffer` attachments and `DepthBuffer` attachments. 
At least a single `ColorBuffer` attachment is needed to be able to draw 
on a `RenderTarget`.

A `ColorBuffer` is a buffer that can hold up to 4 channel color. 
A `ColorBuffer` can hold 8 bit integer, 16 bit float or 32 bit float channels.

A `DepthBuffer` is a buffer that can hold depth and stencil values.

## Creating a render target

The advised method of creating `RenderTarget` instances is to use the 
`renderTarget {}` builder. 
 
```kotlin
val rt = renderTarget(640, 480) {}
``` 
 
This creates a render target, but the render target does not have 
attachments that can hold the actual
image data. In the following snippet a render target with a single color 
buffer attachment is created using the builder. 
 
```kotlin
val rt = renderTarget(640, 480) {
    colorBuffer()
}
``` 
 
## Drawing on a render target

Use `drawer.isolatedWithTarget()` to draw into an off-screen buffer.
 
Once updated, we can either draw it onto the screen (as this example shows) 
or process its color buffer further using [filters](/ORX/imageFilters.html) or custom shaders. 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        // -- build a render target with a single color buffer attachment
        val rt = renderTarget(width, height) {
            colorBuffer()
        }
        
        extend {
            drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rt) {
                drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK)
                drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.WHITE
                drawer.stroke = null
                drawer.rectangle(40.0, 40.0, 80.0, 80.0)
            }
            
            // draw the backing color buffer to the screen
            drawer.image(rt.colorBuffer(0))
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
## Drawing contours or shapes on a render target

When drawing `ShapeContour` or `Shape` instances, both 
a color buffer and a depth buffer are required. 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        // -- build a render target with color and depth buffer attachments
        val rt = renderTarget(width, height) {
            colorBuffer()
            depthBuffer() // <--
        }
        
        drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rt) {
            drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.PINK)
            
            // A closed contour with 12 random points defining 12 straight segments
            drawer.contour(ShapeContour.fromPoints(List(12) {
                drawer.bounds.uniform(50.0)
            }, true))
        }
        
        extend {
            drawer.image(rt.colorBuffer(0))
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
If we forget to include a depth buffer we will be reminded with the following error message:
`drawing org.openrndr.shape.contours requires a render target with a stencil attachment`
    
## Render targets and projection transformations

Note that the [projection matrix](/drawing/transformations.html#projection-matrix) 
has to fit the render target. 
This becomes obvious __if the dimensions of the window and the dimensions of the render target differ__. 
In case of orthographic (2D) projections one can call `ortho(rt)`: 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        // -- build a render target with a single color buffer attachment
        val rt = renderTarget(400, 400) {
            colorBuffer()
        }
        
        extend {
            drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rt) {
                drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK)
                
                // -- set the orthographic transform that matches with the render target
                ortho(rt)
                
                drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.WHITE
                drawer.stroke = null
                drawer.rectangle(40.0, 40.0, 80.0, 80.0)
            }
            
            // -- draw the backing color buffer to the screen
            drawer.image(rt.colorBuffer(0))
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
If we forget to do this the graphics rendered onto our render target may be displaced or have an unexpected scale.

## Compositing using render targets and alpha channels 

OPENRNDR allows for compositing using `RenderTargets` through the use of 
transparency encoded in alpha channels. The following code snippet uses 
two `RenderTarget` instances and clears them using `ColorRGBa.TRANSPARENT`. 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        val rt0 = renderTarget(width, height) {
            colorBuffer()
        }
        val rt1 = renderTarget(width, height) {
            colorBuffer()
        }
        
        extend {
            drawer.stroke = null
            
            // -- bind our first render target, clear it, draw on it, unbind it
            drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rt0) {
                drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.TRANSPARENT)
                drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.WHITE
                drawer.rectangle(40.0, 40.0, 80.0, 80.0)
            }
            
            // -- bind our second render target, clear it, draw on it, unbind it
            drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rt1) {
                drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.TRANSPARENT)
                drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.PINK
                drawer.rectangle(140.0, 140.0, 80.0, 80.0)
            }
            // -- draw the backing color buffer to the screen
            drawer.image(rt0.colorBuffer(0))
            drawer.image(rt1.colorBuffer(0))
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
## Creating high precision floating point render targets

The default color buffer format is unsigned 8 bit RGBa. There is support 
for floating point render targets. 
 
```kotlin
val rt = renderTarget(640, 480) {
    colorBuffer(ColorFormat.RGBa, ColorType.FLOAT16)
    colorBuffer(ColorFormat.RGBa, ColorType.FLOAT32)
}
``` 
 
## Multi-sample anti-aliasing

Render targets can be configured to use multi-sample anti-aliasing. 
All color and depth buffers that are added 
in the `renderTarget {}` builder will be created with the same multi 
sample configuration. 
 
```kotlin
// -- here we create a multi-sampled render target
val rt = renderTarget(640, 480, multisample = BufferMultisample.SampleCount(8)) {
    colorBuffer(ColorFormat.RGBa, ColorType.FLOAT16)
    colorBuffer(ColorFormat.RGBa, ColorType.FLOAT32)
}
``` 
 
The color buffers that are attached to a multi-sampled render target 
cannot be drawn directly. In order to use the color buffer it has 
to be resolved first. 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        // -- build a render target with color and depth buffer attachments
        val rt = renderTarget(width, height, multisample = BufferMultisample.SampleCount(8)) {
            colorBuffer()
            depthBuffer()
        }
        
        val resolved = colorBuffer(width, height)
        
        extend {
            drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rt) {
                drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK)
                drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.WHITE
                drawer.stroke = null
                drawer.circle(0.0, 0.0, 400.0)
            }
            
            // -- resolve the render target attachment to `resolved`
            rt.colorBuffer(0).copyTo(resolved)
            
            // draw the backing color buffer to the screen
            drawer.image(resolved)
            
            // draw a second circle with no multisampling to compare
            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.WHITE
            drawer.stroke = null
            drawer.circle(width * 1.0, height * 1.0, 400.0)
        }
    }
}
``` 
 
## Depth Buffer
    
A depth buffer is required to be able to draw `Shape` and `ShapeContour` 
elements on a render target. Without a depth buffer the program will
fail to run and an error message will remind you of this requirement.

When drawing 3D graphics a depth buffer is required so elements near the
camera are drawn in front of elements farther away from it.

## Clearing buffers
    
 
```kotlin
// clear the color buffer
rt.clearColor(0, ColorRGBa.TRANSPARENT)

// clear the depth buffer
rt.clearDepth()
``` 
 
## Named attachments 
 
```kotlin
val rt = renderTarget(640, 480) {
    colorBuffer("albedo", ColorFormat.RGBa, ColorType.FLOAT16)
    colorBuffer("position", ColorFormat.RGBa, ColorType.FLOAT32)
}
```
